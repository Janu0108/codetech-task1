This Python program functions as a basic calculator, allowing users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation, then it performs the selected operation and displays the result. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

Function Definitions:

add(x, y): This function takes two arguments x and y, and returns their sum.
subtract(x, y): This function takes two arguments x and y, and returns the result of subtracting y from x.
multiply(x, y): This function takes two arguments x and y, and returns their product.
divide(x, y): This function takes two arguments x and y, and returns the result of dividing x by y. If y is zero, it returns an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.
Calculator Function:

The calculator() function is the main function that handles user interaction and the workflow of the calculator.
It begins by printing a welcome message.
A while loop is used to repeatedly prompt the user for input and perform calculations until the user decides to exit.
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers. If the input is not numeric, it catches the error and asks the user to enter valid numeric values.
It then displays a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and asks the user to choose one.
Operation Choice and Calculation:

Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is called to perform the operation.
The result of the operation is printed to the console.
Repeat or Exit:

After displaying the result, the program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.
If the user inputs 'yes', the loop continues and the user can perform another calculation.
If the user inputs anything other than 'yes', the loop exits and the program prints a thank you message and terminates.
Example Usage
When the program is run, it will interact with the user as follows:

Ask for the first number.
Ask for the second number.
Display a menu of operations and ask the user to choose one.
Perform the chosen operation and display the result.

Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation.
Repeat or exit based on the user's response.
